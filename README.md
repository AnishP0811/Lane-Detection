# Lane-Detection 

#### **Introduction**  
Lane detection plays a crucial role in modern transportation systems, enhancing vehicle navigation for both autonomous and assisted driving technologies. This project aims to develop a **robust lane detection system** utilizing **computer vision techniques in OpenCV** to identify lane markings in diverse driving conditions. The system processes video frames, applies image preprocessing, extracts lane boundaries, and overlays detected lanes onto the original image for improved visibility and real-time guidance.  

#### **Problem Statement**  
Accidents due to **lane departures, improper lane changes, or driver distractions** pose serious challenges to road safety. Traditional methods of lane monitoring are either manual or inefficient in complex environments. This project seeks to provide an automated **lane detection solution**, ensuring accurate lane identification even in **low-light**, **adverse weather**, or **high-speed scenarios**.  

#### **Proposed Solution**  
The project leverages **OpenCV** and **classical computer vision techniques** to detect lane boundaries dynamically. The core methodology includes:  
- **Image Preprocessing**: Grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and enhancement of lane markings.  
- **Edge Detection**: Utilizing **Canny Edge Detection** to highlight lane boundaries.  
- **Region of Interest Selection**: Filtering out irrelevant details to focus on the road lanes.  
- **Hough Transform for Line Detection**: Identifying straight-line features representing lane markers.  
- **Lane Segmentation & Overlay**: Separating left and right lanes and overlaying the results for clear visualization.
